Tool for review and spell check of Flash banner ads

It contains a spell checker with a list of incorrectly spelled words. It also shows you key info for reviewing the ad along with tools for control and playback. Frame and framerate indicators and the ability to pause and save a screen shot of the ad also assist in communication during the feedback process.

This is an ActionScript 3 AIR application. I developed this to help streamline the review process of banner ads for an ad agency. Currently it supports ActionScript 2 banner ads with support for ActionScript 3 banner ads nearing completion. ActionScript 2 was prioritized due to the number of banner ad servers out there still demanding as2 / fp8. It contains a bridge to communicate spell checking and other info between the as2 and as3 sides.

The project uses a number of other libraries which are included. Robotlegs 2, Grant Skinner's Spell checker as3 library, Senocular's SWFReader, and the Greensock tween library to make things pretty. Will update everything with comments soon.
